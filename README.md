## üöÄ How to Run Locally

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Save the files:** Save the provided HTML, JavaScript, and CSS code into three separate files in the same directory:
    * `index.html` (for the HTML structure)
    * `script.js` (for the JavaScript logic)
    * `style.css` (for the CSS styling)
2.  **Add Images (Optional but recommended for full visual fidelity):** For the budget summary section to look correct, you would need placeholder images named `income.png`, `expense.png`, and `budjet.png` in the same directory.
3.  **Open the file:** Double-click the `index.html` file in your file explorer. It will open automatically in your default web browser.
